# The Hidden Traps in Decision Making - On Making Smart Decisions

## 

- Heuristics \-\>  we use unconscious routines to cope with the complexity inherent in most decisions.
- Flaws \-\> there are many in our decision making process.
- The best defense is always awareness

### Anchoring Trap

- The mind gives disproportionate weight to the first information it receives.
- Initial impressions, estimations, or data anchor subsequent thoughts and judgements.
- If there is no easy way to estimate, don't take others' numbers as anchor.
- Techniques:
    - Think about the problem on your own before  consulting others.
    - Be careful to avoid  anchoring your advisers, consultants. Tell them as little as possible about your ideas.
    - Look for opportunities to use anchors to your own advantage. \-\> suggest high if you are a seller.

### The Status\-Quo Trap

- Decision makers display a strong bias toward alternatives that perpetuate the status quo.
- Sticking with the status quo represents, in most cases, the safer course because it puts us at less psychological risk.
- In business, where sins of commission \(doing something\) tend to be punished much more severely than sins of omission \(doing nothing\), the status quo holds a particularly strong attraction.
- Techniques:
    -  Always remind yourself of your objectives and examine how they would be served by the status quo
    - Avoid exaggerating the effort or cost involved in switching from the status quo.

### The Sunk\-Cost Trap

- Our deep\-seated biases is to make choices in a way that justifies past choices
- It’s because they are unwilling, consciously or not, to admit to a mistake. 
- Acknowledging a poor decision in one’s personal life may be purely a private matter, involving only one’s self\-esteem, but in business, a bad decision is often a very public matter, inviting critical comments from colleagues or bosses.
- Techniques:
    - "When you find yourself in a hole, the best thing you can do is stop digging."
    - Examine why admitting to an earlier mistake distresses you.
    - Don’t cultivate a failure\-fearing culture that leads employees to perpetuate their mistakes.

### The Confirming\-Evidence Trap

- The confirming\-evidence bias not only affects where we go to collect evidence but also how we interpret the evidence we do receive, leading us to give too much weight to supporting information and too little to conflicting information.
- Techniques:
    - Always check to see whether you are examining all the evidence with equal rigor.
    - Get someone you respect to play devil’s advocate, to argue against the decision you’re contemplating.
    - Be honest with yourself about your motives.
    - Don’t surround yourself with yes\-men

### The Framing Trap

- The way a problem is framed can profoundly influence the choices you make.
- The strikingly different responses reveal that people are risk averse when a problem is posed in terms of gains \(barges saved\) but risk seeking when a problem is posed in terms of avoiding losses \(barges lost\).
- Techniques:
    - Don’t automatically accept the initial frame, whether it was formulated by you or by someone else. Always try to reframe the problem in various ways.
    - At points throughout the process, particularly near the end, ask yourself how your thinking might change if the framing changed.

### The Estimating and Forecasting Traps

- The overconfidence trap
    - Even though most of us are not very good at making estimates or forecasts, we actually tend to be overconfident about our accuracy.
    - Always start by considering the extremes, the low and high ends of the possible range of values. This will help you avoid being anchored by an initial estimate. Then challenge your estimates of the extremes.
    - Try to imagine circumstances where the actual figure would fall below your low or above your high, and adjust your range accordingly.
- The prudence trap
    - When faced with high\-stakes decisions, we tend to adjust our estimates or forecasts “just to be on the safe side.”
    - Always state your estimates honestly and explain to anyone who will be using them that they have not been adjusted.
    - Emphasize the need for honest input to anyone who will be supplying you with estimates.
- The recallability trap: 
    - Because we frequently base our predictions about future events on our memory of past events, we can be overly influenced by dramatic events—those that leave a strong impression on our memory.
    - Carefully examine all your assumptions to ensure they’re not unduly influenced by your memory.
    - Get actual statistics whenever possible

### Forewarned Is Forearmed

- The best protection against all psychological traps—in isolation or in combination—is awareness. Forewarned is forearmed.
- The traps  can all work in isolation. But, even more dangerous, they can work in concert, amplifying one another.
